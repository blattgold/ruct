# RUCT: imitation (C)rab.
This is a 'standard library' implementation for Rust-Like Syntax and semantics in C.

## Goal
Single-Header library that is compatible with any C-Compiler that allows usage of Rust-like features in C.

## Examples
[Asteroids Clone (wip)](https://github.com/blattgold/ruct_asteroid_clone)

*Work in progress, many features missing and half-finished.*
